    File "../tests/runtests.py", line 79, in runtests
    raise Exception('Tests failed. Got "%s", expected "%s"' % (result, expected_result))
  Exception: Tests failed. Got "END-OF-SCRIPT", expected "isResolvable"

On Win-32 Systems:

Binary Distribution:
===================

Compiled packages for win32 systems can be downloaded from:
https://github.com/pacparser/pacparser/releases

* C Library and pactester:
  -----------------------
To install pacparser C library and pactester, download package
"pacparser-v.v.v-win32.zip" and extract it somewhere on your machine. It will
create a directory - "pacparser-v.v.v". Copy pacparser.dll and pactester.exe
binaries to somewhere on the system where system can find them (e.g. to the
directories that are already in system path like C:\Windows) or simply add
pacparser directory to the system path.

You'll need pacparser.lib to link in pacparser on Visual Studio/C++. On mingw,
you can directly link with pacparser.dll. Here are the detailed instructions to link in pacparser on Visual Studio:
http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/wiki/LinkingOnVisualStudio.

* Python Module
  -------------
To install pacparser python module (available only for Python 2.7 right now),
download package pacparser-python27-v.v.v-win32.zip and extract it somewhere
on your system. To install the module in your PYTHONPATH, simply run install.py
that comes with the compiled binaries.

If it fails for some reason, simply copy "pacparser" sub-directory to
C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\ and you are done.

Compiling from Source Code:
==========================

Compiling pacparser for Windows is a rather involved process and is documented
in detail in README.win32 file included with this package.
